NAME
    Acme::Magic8Ball - ask the Magic 8 Ball a question

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::Magic8Ball qw(ask);
        my $reply = ask("Is this module any use whatsoever?");

    ... you can also pass in your own list of answers ...

        my $reply = ask("What should the next bit be?", 0, 1); # reply will always be 0 or 1

    ... or make answers consistent ...

        use Acme::Magic8Ball qw(ask :consistent);
        for (0..1000) {
            my $reply = ask("Is this module any use whatsoever?"); # reply will always be the same
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This is an almost utterly pointless module. But I needed it. So there.

METHODS
  ask <question> [answers]
    Ask and ye shall receive!

    If you don't pass in an array of answers it will use the traditional
    ones.
